            <h3>Stocks</h3> 
                <p>Investing in stocks means buying a share of a company. Investors can make money if the stock price increases or if the company pays dividends. However, the stock price can also go down, which means they can lose money.</p>
            <h3>Bonds</h3>
                <p>Bonds are a form of long-term investment in which money is lent to a company or government in exchange for interest and repayment of the borrowed principal over an agreed period of time. Bonds are considered a safer investment than stocks, but interest rates are generally lower.</p>
            <h3>ETFs</h3> 
                <p>ETFs offer an easy way to invest in a wide variety of assets without having to buy individual stocks.</p>

            <h3>Cryptocurrency</h3> 
                <p>Cryptocurrencies are a digital form of currency that are used in place of traditional money. The value of cryptocurrencies varies widely and is considered a high-risk investment.</p>
